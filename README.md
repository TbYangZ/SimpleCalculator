# Simple Calculator

## introduction

This project is a simple calculator. You can use it to create a variable, a function, and an expression to get the value.

Variable:

```plain
> var a=1
> a
1.00
> 
```

There are some constant value:

```plain
> pi
3.14
> e
2.72
```

Function:

Only simple functions. Doesn't support recursion functions. 

```plain
> fn f(x) = x*x
> f(10)
100.00
> 
```

There are some inner functions:

```plain
> sqrt(49)
7.00
> sin(0.5 * pi)
1.0
```

Expression:

```plain
> var a=3
> var b=4
> sqrt(a*a+b*b)
5.00
>
```
